Overview of Project:
	This project implements multiple scanning and dominant attribute machine learning workflows.
	The input format is defined by the LERS specificatoin (reference TBD)
	Multiple scanning selects the best k-cutpoints for all given attributes using minimum conditional entropy.
	then the dominant attribute process begins.  If the A_curr table is
	consistent with the data, then the process stops.  If not, the first elementary block with conflicting cases
	is selected as a subtable for the looping process. (implement with a priority queue?)


Outline for project:

Components:
	* LERS parser
	* Determine partitions
		from single attribute
		from multiple attributes
	* Determine consistency
	

Notes:
	* Save cases by row number into dictionary object
	* Include check for consistency of data table or condition that A_curr is consistent with A
